# Revisiting Operation IceBridge snow-on-sea-ice measurements in the Arctic ✈️❄️

This repository represents the research I did during my master thesis project (the thesis itself is contained in /Documentation). The aim was to highlight strenghts and weaknesses of the NASA Operation IceBridge (OIB) snow depth measurements performed with the snow radar by validating with in-situ measurements of snow depths.


### Necessary data
To reproduce the results (or do own experimentation), there are several necessary datasets. For most of them I included a downloading script in /Downloads, which loads the data into /Data.

From OIB the following data products are used:
1. OIB L1B snow radar echograms (https://nsidc.org/data/irsno1b/versions/2)
2. OIB L1B ATM Elevation (https://nsidc.org/data/ilatm1b/versions/2)
3. OIB L4 Quicklook data product (https://nsidc.org/data/nsidc-0708/versions/1)

The in-situ measurements can be found on Josh Kings GitHub:
1. ECCC Eureka 2014 campaign (https://github.com/kingjml/ECCC-Eureka-2014-Snow-on-Sea-Ice-Campaign)
2. ECCC Eureka 2016 campaign (https://github.com/kingjml/ECCC-Eureka-2016-OpenData)

For large scale analysis the University of Bremens multi-year ice concentration data is used: https://seaice.uni-bremen.de/ice-type/
